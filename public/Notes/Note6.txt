Redux Thunk Middleware

Async Action Creators

Package required :
1. axios -> is a function for API Calling
2. redux-thunk package -> its a middleware, used to define async action creator.

Now, what is action creator function?
It a function which not only return action payload but also return a function.
here, fetchUsers() is a fn which consists of business logic + action dispatching.
This is what redux-thunk middleware do.
such functions are called Async action creator functions

Example : 

export const fetchUsers = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch(fetchUsersRequest())
    axios
      .get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
      .then(response => {
        // response.data is the users
        const users = response.data
        dispatch(fetchUsersSuccess(users))
      })
      .catch(error => {
        // error.message is the error message
        dispatch(fetchUsersFailure(error.message))
      })
  }
}

The above Example is what difficult to test while doing unit testing.
Therefore, redux-saga middleware is used to segregate business logic and action payload.
In Saga, we only write business logic and communicate (action with saga) with the help of action "type"
which further makes the code simpler & easy to test.
