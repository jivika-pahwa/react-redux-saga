fetching API - fetch() Method

previously, have used this fetch() method of JS
    
let ApiData = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
but this wont give the result cuz its mandatory to use custom middleware for async actions.
middleware like thunk or Saga.


Redux - Saga

Generator function -> used to handle async Operations.
Part of ES7/8
return data when it gets the result from API (Async Operation)
need to use yield as well
