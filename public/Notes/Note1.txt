React -> 

Library for the development of web application.
Fast & Easy to use. 

Not a complete package as its not a framework. We need to add library for every functionality.
No State Management b/w components, you can use contextAPI but for smaller projects


Redux -> 

State Management library or global data Management.
communicate within components - passing state from one component to another.

A predictable state container - that means change at one place should reflect to another place as well
for example if am changing a quantity from 1 with 2 it should reflect in total billing amount as well.

like a store room where we can store our data & get our data back when in need.

how we can use redux-data?
redux create a wrapper above react application.

view -> action -> reducer -> store -> back to view 


Saga ->
API Data Handling middleware
API Calling can be done using -> Promise, async - await feature
Here we will use Saga which is a middleware for calling async operations (API).
whenever we'll call API, we will call Saga through action.
